                    <h5>Learning web development is really fun, but it can also be incredibly frustrating.</h5>
                    <p>If you’re in the process of learning how to code, you might be stressed about…</p>
                    <p> … feeling like you’re not learning fast enough.</p>
                     <p>… frantically looking up everything on Stack Overflow every single day.</p>
                    <p> … battling impostor syndrome big time.</p>

                    <p class="middle">Let me tell ya something. I was there too.</p>

                    <p>Almost 10 years ago, I was actually in a bit of a rut, and feeling directionless in life. Most of my jobs had been temporary office jobs, and I couldn’t seem to find my way out. By chance, I ended up in a data entry job off of Craigslist, no less. Along with the data entry, they trained me in some programming.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="web-chill">
                    <h5>I enjoyed the challenge, and even more, I enjoyed coding!</h5>
                    <p>
                        Two years later I got a full-time web developer job. I was still extremely green at that point, but luckily, I had a very supportive supervisor and coworkers. And yes, there was some frantic Googling and Stack Overflow-ing.</p>

                        <p>Today, almost seven years later, I can look back at my past self and see how far I’ve come. In that time, I’ve learned a lot about coding, and about learning how to code.</p>

                       <p>I’ve gotten over the hump of feeling incredibly inadequate and terrified of being found out, to feeling confident that I have the skills to learn anything new that I put my mind to.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="web-skill">
                    <h5>And you can learn those skills too!</h5>
                    <p>I’m not going to sugarcoat it– learning how to code proficiently is REALLY HARD, and it does take time. But you can learn how to code, and you can learn how to learn.</p>

                    <p>And that’s what I want to do for you!</p>
                    
                    <p>I hope that my experiences and knowledge can help others on their coding journey.</p>
